# Siple php livewire poc

### Simple POC to use PHP livewire to create a simple page with a table and a search using POKEMONS!

First impression of the new framework:
- Easy to implement if you know well laravel and the ecosystem
- It brings all the laravel boilerplate, so to create a simple page with a component and a form we have to setup the whole laravel project
- Overall a good tool if you want to create something quickly and be ready to test in a day
